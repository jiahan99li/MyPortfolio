                <p>
                    I am Jiahan V Li, or you can call me Vinny. I am a Software Engineer, born in New York and raised in Spain of Chinese descent.
                </p>
                <h3>How did you become interested in programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    I became interested in programming a long time ago. When I was younger, I got to experience the actual switch from those thick and small brick phones to the smartphones we use 
                    these days. Growing up experiencing the change, and seeing how the applications and websites were implemented and how they slowly evolved, really got me interested in programming. 
                    The first project that I ever did was not related to actual programming, I basically created and designed the restaurant menus for my parent's restaurant. After couple of 
                    years, I realized that many restaurants also started using the internet, creating their personal website for their store and including events and advertising, so 
                    I then decided to do some research and started learning HTML and CSS leading to me later on creating and designing a simple website for my parent's restaurant
                    where I managed and updated it over time for several years until recently. Besides creating and designing the website for my own parent's store, I later on also prgorammed 
                    a website for one of my friend's parent store, where I also implemented some Javascript I had recently learnt. I was extremely thrilled that I had managed to solve some 
                    difficulties I had at the beginning and managed to develop a website by myself, I couldn't help myself to keep on learning more about programming, and that is why I chose 
                    this career path.
                </p>
                <h3>What are some of your future goals?</h3>
                <p>
                    As of programming, my goal is to keep learning ang improving my skills, whether is learning more languages or problem solving and algorithms, with the ambition to become 
                    a great team player, being able to work and co-operate and helping each other as a team to become better versions of ourselves, and to someday become a true leader, helping 
                    either a team get the best outcome for whatever we are assigned or to help guide future entry-level programmers.

                    <p>
                        As I was so interested in programming, my first languages were HTML and CSS, I wanted to try out my skills on something a little more serious, that is why I started 
                        developing websites for these two restaurants, and later one managed and updated the site every once in awhile. (In Spain)

                    <h3>Sales Representative</h3>
                    <p>
                        As my first job since I came back to the United States, and as a Freshman in college, I wanted to challenge myself and tryout a job that was totally different to what 
                        I was already interested in. I started working as a Sales Representative, and even though it was tought to combine school and job, but I gained a lot of new experiences 
                        and learnt about sales and business making myself more interested in business and economics, besides my already interest in Software development.

                        This job didn't have much to do with my field, but knowing that if I keep moving onto the programming field, I would then have less chance to search and actually experience 
                        and work in restaurants, thatâ€™s why I chose this part time job. Even though it wasnâ€™t related to my field but I was still able to learn new experiences in terms of customer 
                        service and new knowledge about Korean BBQ and the Korean culture.

                                This is a social media, it is not final yet since I am now focusing it more on the app development of smartphones
                                for this same Social Media, but before moving on to the app development I made sure that at least it was functional. Ultimately, 
                                the plan is to have both the website and the app finished and functional.

                                I decided to do some research on how to design and develop a smartphone application. I found out that there are many frameworks 
                                that could be coded once and then be translated into iOS and Android application, React Native for example. I then found out that 
                                Google also released a framework for app development couple of years ago and decided to go with it. It was then when I decided to 
                                self learn Flutter, using Dart Language. I was able to design and develop a smartphone social media app that could run on both iOS 
                                and Android.

                                I have been learning Java in class, but never really programmed an actual fully functional program, so I wanted to somewhat create 
                                one. Since I have never used Java for an actual full program, I was still doubting how to implement some of the code that I learnt 
                                or maybe if there was other code or functions that I did not learn in order to program an actual program, so I decided to search for 
                                tutorials on some interesting projects in order to get used to the way to use the code, and found the tutorial on Flappy Bird, 
                                throughout the tutorial I was able to see how some codes and functions that I knew could be implemented in a functioning program and 
                                also learnt some new code or functions which I will be able to use it for future projects or job.

                            ambitious to learn more languages, so I recently self-learned <strong>Flutter</strong> using <strong>Dart</strong> language.
